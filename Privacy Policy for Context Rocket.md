Privacy Policy for Context Rocket
Last Updated: October 28, 2025

Introduction
Welcome to Context Rocket ("we", "us", or "our"). This Chrome extension was created to enhance your browsing experience by providing powerful multi-search capabilities directly from the context menu. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information the extension does and does not collect, and how it is used.

Information We Do Not Collect
We want to be crystal clear: Context Rocket does not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data.

We do not track your browsing history.
We do not record your search queries.
We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII).
We do not have a server where any user data is sent or stored.
How the Extension Works and Data It Handles
Context Rocket's functionality is entirely client-side, meaning all operations happen locally on your computer.

1. Selected Text and Image URLs
When you right-click on selected text or an image and choose a search engine from the Context Rocket menu, the extension uses that selected text or image URL to construct a search query. This query is then sent directly to the third-party search engine you selected by opening a new tab.

The selected text or image URL is only sent to the search engine you choose and is never sent to us or any other third party. The handling of this data is then subject to the privacy policy of that specific search engine.

2. Extension Settings
Context Rocket allows you to customize your search engines, create groups, and set preferences. These settings are saved using Chrome's built-in storage API (`chrome.storage.sync`).

Local and Synced Storage: Your settings are stored locally on your computer and may be automatically synchronized across your devices by Google if you are logged into a Google account in your browser. This is a feature of the Chrome browser, and we do not have access to this data.
Import/Export: The extension provides a feature to export your settings as a JSON file and import them. This process is entirely local. The configuration file is saved to your computer and is not transmitted over the network by the extension.
Permissions
The extension requests the following permissions to function correctly:

"contextMenus": To add the search options to your right-click menu.
"tabs": To open new tabs for your searches.
"storage": To save your extension settings locally.
No data is collected or transmitted as a result of these permissions beyond what is described above.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy in the future if the extension's functionality changes. Any updates will be reflected in a new version of the extension and an updated "Last Updated" date on this page. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
